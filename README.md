# normalization-by-evaluation

Normalization-by-evaluation in miniKanren

Based on a recent conversation with Edward Kmett, and Edward's (non-relational) Haskell code.

Thank you to Michael Arntzenius for a previous tutorial on normalization-by-evaluation, and a separate attempt at implementing normalization-by-evaluation relationally.
